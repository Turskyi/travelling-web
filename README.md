# Travelling
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## PROJECT SPECIFICATION

• Programming language: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org);

• SDK: [Next JS](https://nextjs.org);

• Version control system: [Git](https://git-scm.com);

• Git Hosting Service: [GitHub](https://github.com);

• CI/CD: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/features/previews) is used to
deliver the new releases to the production environment after every push to the **master** branch;

• Api: https://restcountries.com/;

• Architectural pattern: [Monolith](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/common-web-application-architectures#all-in-one-applications);

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, you must have Node.js on your machine.
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load `Indie_Flower`, a custom Google Font.

• **Code Readability:** code is easily readable with no unnecessary blank lines, no unused variables
or methods, and no commented-out code, all variables, methods, and resource IDs are descriptively
named such that another developer reading the code can easily understand their function.

## Credits

This project is based on
the [Learn SWR by Building a Pokemon App (NextJS, React, TypeScript)](https://youtu.be/5a1-BuwwemY?si=PYQE7XuGUx0_JdPE) by [Coding in Flow](https://github.com/codinginflow) YouTube channel.
All credit goes to the original author [Florian Walther](https://github.com/florianwalther-private). I only followed along and made some minor changes.
